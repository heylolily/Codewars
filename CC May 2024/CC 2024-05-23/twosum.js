// Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

// For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

// The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

// Based on: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

// twoSum([1, 2, 3], 4) // returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]
// twoSum([3, 2, 4], 6) // returns [1, 2] or [2, 1]

function twoSum(numbers, target) {
    let pairs = {}
    for (let i=0;i<numbers.length;i++) {
      // find the remainder, this is the number thats needed to make a pair
      let remainder = target - numbers[i]
      // if that number is in the pairs object, we can return that number with i as a pair
      if (remainder in pairs) {
        return [pairs[remainder], i]
      }
      // add the number and the index in the pairs object otherwise
      pairs[numbers[i]] = i
    }
}

//an interesting approach i found
function twoSum(numbers, target) {
    let seen = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
      let x = numbers[i], y = target - x;
      if (seen.has(y))
        return [seen.get(y), i];
      seen.set(x, i);
    }
